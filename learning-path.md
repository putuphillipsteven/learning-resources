# Learning Resources

This repository contains learning resources how to be a front end web developer. Full stack developer maybe? Using javascript.

## Why this document written in english?

Honestly, most online resources are written in english,
and to become a programmer(good programmer, of course), learn english is a must.
These documentation might contain some inappropriate english sentences.

## **HTML CSS**

Let say you have already known HTML CSS very well, its good. But there's no harm in getting certified, as it can help us when applying for jobs.

- [Responsive Web Design | freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

The link above is an online resource where we can learn `Responsive Web Design` and also earn a certificate.

## **Javascript**

Like a said, this documentation is about how to be a web developer using Javascript.

- [Javascript | freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)

In the certification mentioned above, you'll learn stuff like how to check if a word is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) or not. You might wonder, when the fuck we ever need to check if a word is a palindrome? The answer is: when you're applying for a job. Companies often give logical tests, and sometimes, they involve live coding. What is live coding? It's when you're given a task to complete online while being observed by the HR interviewer, typically in real-time.

- [Javascript | javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

Link above will redirect you into javascript.info website, that contain many documentation about Javascript. I think its a good learning resources.

## **Front End Mentor**

Front End Mentor is a website that offers numerous challenges for you to tackle, complete with style guides and both desktop and mobile designs. The site explains that if you achieve a certain score, you might get hired by someone. Honestly, I haven't tried this feature myself, but it's a great platform to sharpen your skills and knowledge as a web developer.

## **React**

In my opinion, best place to learn a framework or whatever it is, the documentation it self.

- [React Official Web](https://react.dev/)

In web above we also learn how to build [Tic Tac Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) web app, [Thinking In React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react), and other documentations. In my opinion, you must really understand Javascript well if you want to learn React. But, if you can combine learning React with learning Javascript, its great. At least, you can finish the [Javascript](#javascript) certification above first.

## **Front End Development Libraries Certification**

Maybe i start like antek-antek of freeCodeCamp, but yeah, this web help me lot about learning, and, the certificate of course, it will help us buling up our certification section of our CV.

## **Back End Development and APIs Certification**

- [Back End Development and APIs Certification](#https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)

If we want to learn Next JS, do we have known Back End Development? I think yes, because it will need us to have understand how APIs on Back End is called, and Next JS tutorial below will have a Back End section that I think we must known Back End first.

## **Next JS**

Again, in my opinion, the best place to learn is the official website.

- [Next JS Official Web](https://nextjs.org/m)

The link below is going to guide us in building a Next.js fullstack Dashboard app that will be fully authenticated by the end of the project. Also this link will give us step how to deploy our website.

## **Code Wars**

Is a platform designed to help sharpen your logical thinking and coding skills. Its really important for the sake of finding jobs.
