# Learning Resources

This repository contains learning resources how to be a front end web developer. Full stack developer maybe? Using javascript.

## Why this document written in english?

Honestly, most online resources are written in english,
and to become a programmer(good programmer, of course), learn english is a must.
These documentation might contain some inappropriate english sentences.

## Content List

1. [HTML | CSS](#html-css)
1. [Javascript](#javascript)
1. [Front End Mentor](#front-end-mentor)
1. [React](#react)
1. [Next JS](#next-js)
1. [Code Wars](#code-wars)

## **HTML CSS**

Let say you have already known HTML CSS very well, its good. But there's no harm in getting certified, as it can help us when applying for jobs.
Believe me, this certification stuff is boring.

The link above is an online resource where we can learn `Responsive Web Design` and also earn a certificate.
The certificate we obtain will be available online as well.

## **Javascript**

Like a said, this documentation is about how to be a web developer using Javascript.

In the certification mentioned above, you'll learn how to check if a word is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) and more. You might wonder, when the fuck we ever need to check if a word is a palindrome? The answer is: when you're applying for a job. Companies often give logical tests, and sometimes, they involve live coding. What is live coding? It's when you're given a task to complete online while being observed by the HR interviewer, typically in real-time. Thinks like checking palindrome also train our logical thinking.

## **Front End Mentor**

Front End Mentor is a website that offers numerous challenges for you to tackle, complete with style guides and both desktop and mobile designs. The site explains that if you achieve a certain score, you might get hired by someone. Honestly, I haven't tried this feature myself, but it's a great platform to sharpen your skills and knowledge as a web developer.

## **React**

In my opinion, best place to learn a framework or whatever it is, the documentation it self.

- [React Official Web](https://react.dev/)

In web above we also learn how to build [Tic Tac Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) web app, [Thinking In React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react), and other documentations.

## **Next JS**

Again, maybe the best place to learn is the official website.

- [Next JS Official Web](https://nextjs.org/m)

The link below is going to guide us in building a Next.js Dashboard app that will be fully authenticated by the end of the project.

## **Code Wars**

Is a platform designed to help sharpen your logical thinking and coding skills.
